### **Problem Statement**

In modern business environments, organizations face significant challenges in managing customer complaints efficiently. Customers expect quick resolutions, consistent follow-ups, and personalized communication. However, traditional complaint management methods—such as manual tracking, email-based logging, or spreadsheets—are often inefficient, error-prone, and lack transparency. This leads to delayed responses, unresolved complaints, decreased customer satisfaction, and even loss of business.

Moreover, customer service agents often struggle with tracking complaint statuses, prioritizing urgent issues, and accessing historical data quickly. Without a centralized system, it becomes difficult to analyze complaint trends, evaluate performance metrics, and ensure compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs). Hence, there is a need for a robust, automated, and scalable solution to manage complaints effectively and enhance customer experience.
